## My Values

### Platinum Rule is the Best Rule
I like the Golden rule, but I truly believe in the Platinum rule. That being, "treat others how they want to be treated."
I have a lot of room to improve on this, but it is my guiding principle. Getting someone into a space where they feel safe and trusted, based on their preferences is vitally important to me because that is where people do their best work.

### Empathy Drives Results
My favorite ISM is "We are the They." I've been in some very divisive and combative organizations where blame is the primary tool to get things done. These organizations were fraught with stress, inefficiency and low job satisfaction. Bringing a level of empathy to your interactions with others in our company will only lead to mutual understanding and shared goals, enabling execution at a much higher level than those organizations that are spending their time fighting with themselves.

### We're all Professionals
You were hired because you have a set of skills that are valuable. You have a way of working that is the best for you. If I try to micromanage and tell you how to do your job, then I'm not doing a good job at mine. I'm certainly not going to be more successful than you at your job, which is why you are doing it and I'm not. As long as we are making good progress and you are integrating with our team, I take a hands-off approach. This goes for our work processes and tools. My primary function is to help you do your job by removing roadblocks and providing feedback.  If I have to repetitively tell you how to do your job, we'll probably be having some difficult conversations.

### Mistakes are the Vehicle of Knowledge
The best way to figure out how to do something right is to do it wrong. I expect that we will have our share of failures, but we must always be learning from them and growing.

### Shared Responsibility
We should approach our work with a sense of urgency and not let 'we don't own that' get in the way of progress. Don't let process get in the way of getting things done. Reach out, make connections, keep things moving. The hustle you put in to get the job done, the more people around you will be insipred to do the same.

### Call Bullsh*/t
We're a very empowered organization. Few companies of our size allow for the level of autonomy we enjoy as Team Members. Use that power to call out things that stink. Don't assume others are smelling the same thing. Knowing we're walking into a potentially bad situation helps raise our level of awareness and deal with it head-on, instead of it being a surprise later.

### Balance
I strongly believe in the importance of family and having a life outside of work. However, there will occassionaly be times where some sacrifices to that time need to be made for the benefit of our team, but you can expect that I will be making the sacrifice with you. I will also commit to making these types of requests as infrequently as possible, since it is usually indicative of poor planning - which is something I strive to avoid.

## What drives me?
There are few things as important to people as having a roof over their heads and a sense of security that possessing their own dwelling can provide. We get to help satisfy that need and improve lives every day, and we are lucky to be in this position. I expect myself and my team to understand the unique position we are in and express a level of gratitude for being here.

I also believe in working to live and not living to work, so you won't see me working off hours - unless something goes wrong, we are doing a deployment, or I'm at my in-laws and need an excuse to get out of a conversation.  I don't expect you to work off hours, unless similar aforementioned circumstances arise. If I do need you, I will proactively reach out to you.

### Building Cool Shit
This is the best part of the job and what really motivates me. Making things that astound our clients just feels good. The more we do this, the more satisfaction I personally derive. So this is what I'm going to push you to do. Make awesome stuff.
